There are two folders:
1) CPG walking gait - motion (angles applied to head and arms); - no motion (no movement in the hands and head).
* You can change the walking size, changing the time, and to speed the velocity just changing the omega and amplitude.


2) Parameterized Motions walking gait - motion (angles applied to head and arms); - no motion (no movement in the hands and head; - non linear (different approach to calculate the next target).
* You can change the walking size, by setting the number the steps do you want, and also you can speed up the velocity changing the alpha and dt in the Jacobian parameters.
